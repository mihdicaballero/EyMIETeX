## Building your thesis - LaTeX / PDFLaTeX

### Using the batch file on Windows OS (PDFLaTeX)

*    Open command prompt and navigate to the directory with the tex file. Run:

    `compile-thesis-windows.bat`.

*    Alternatively, double click on `compile-thesis-windows.bat`


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage details

Thesis information such as title, author, year, degree, etc., and other meta-data can be modified in `thesis-info.tex`

### Class options

The class file, `PhDThesisPSnPDF`, is based on the standard `book` class

It supports the following custom options in the documentclass in thesis.tex:

(Usage `\documentclass[a4paper,11pt,print]{PhDThesisPSnPDF}`)

*   `a4paper` (default as per the University guidelines) or `a5paper`: Paper size

*   `11pt` or `12pt`: The University of Cambridge guidelines recommend using a minimum font size of 11pt (12pt is preferred) and 10pt for footnotes. This template also supports `10pt`.

*   `oneside` or `twoside` (default): This is especially useful for printing double side (twoside) or single side.

*   `print`: Supports Print and Online Version with different page margins and hyperlink styles.
    Use `print` in the options to activate Print Version with appropriate margins and page layout and view styles.
    Leaving the options field blank will activate Online version.

*   `custommargin`: You can alter the margin dimension for both print and online version by using the keyword `custommargin` in the options. Then you can define the dimensions of the margin in the `preamble.tex` file:

        \ifsetCustomMargin
          \RequirePackage[left=37mm,right=30mm,top=35mm,bottom=30mm]{geometry}
          \setFancyHdr
        \fi
    `\setFancyHdr` should be called when using custom margins for proper header/footer dimensions

    `\ifsetMargin` is deprecated, please use `\ifsetCustomMargin` instead.

*   `index`: Including this option builds the index, which is placed at the end of the thesis.

    Instructions on how to use the index can be found [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Indexing#Using_makeidx).

    _Note_: the package `makeidx` is used to create the index.

*   `abstract`: This option enables only the thesis title page and the abstract with title and author to be printed.

*   `chapter`: This option enables only the specified chapter and it's references. Useful for review and corrections.

*   `draft`: The default draft mode supports some special features such as line numbers, images, and water mark with
    timestamp and custom text. Position of the text can be modified in `preamble.tex`.

*   `draftclassic`: This mode is similar to the default draft mode in the book class. Images are not loaded.

*   `lineno`: Enables pagewise line numbering on the outer edge. You can switch-off line numbering by specifying `nolineno` in the options.

*   `flushleft`: The University recommends using ragged right or flush left alignment for texts. The reason behind this is left justifying a text may exclude a certain readers. Dyslexic people find it hard to read justified text. You can enable `raggedright` option in the document class by passing `flushleft` argument. Default is flush left and right.

### Title page

The front page (title page) resizes to fit your title length. You can modify the options in `thesis-info.tex`.

* `\subtitle` (optional): Adds a subtitle to your thesis.

* `\college` (optional): This option adds the name of your college on the bottom left.

If `\college` is defined, the bottom of the title page will look like this:

        King's College 			                                         2014

If `\college` is undefined or blank, the `degreedate` will be centered.

                                        2014

### Abstract separate

*  A separate abstract with the title of the PhD and the candidate name has to be submitted to the Student Registry. This can be generated using `abstract` option in the document class. Ignore subsequent warnings about skipping sections (if any).

*  To generate the separate abstract and the title page, make sure the following commands are in the preamble section of `thesis.tex` file:

        \ifdefineAbstract
        \includeonly{Abstract/abstract}
        \fi

### Chapter mode

*  The chapter mode allows user to only print specific chapters along with references. By default, it excludes everything else in the front matter and appendices. This can done by using `chapter` option in the document class in `thesis.tex`. Ignore subsequent warnings about skipping sections (if any).

*  To generate the separate abstract and the title page, make sure the following commands are in the preamble section of `thesis.tex` file:

		\ifdefineChapter
			\includeonly{Chapter3/chapter3}
		\fi

### Draft

`draft` adds a watermark `draft` text with timestamp and version number at the top or
the bottom of the page. Pagewise line numbering is added on every page. `draft` settings can be tweaked in the `preamble.tex`.

* Use `draftclassic` in the document class options to use the default book class draft mode.

* To add figures in draft mode (default enabled), in the preamble set `\setkeys{Gin}{draft=false}`. `draft=true` disables figures

* To change the watermark text
      \SetDraftText{DRAFT}

* To change the position of the watermark text. Default watermark position is top. The location can be changed to (top / bottom)
      \SetDraftWMPosition{bottom}

* To change the draft version. Default draft version is v1.0.
      \SetDraftVersion{v1.1}

* Watermark grayscale value can be modified. Text grayscale value (should be between 0-black and 1-white). Default value is 0.75
      \SetDraftGrayScale{0.8}


### Custom settings

*   The depth for the table of contents can be set using:

		\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
		\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}
    A depth of [3] indicates to a level of `\subsubsection` or #.#.#.#. Default set as 2.

*   To hide sections from appearing in TOC use: `\tochide\section{Section name}` in your TeX files

*   Define custom caption style for figure and table caption in `preamble.tex` using:

        \RequirePackage[small,bf,figurename=Fig.,labelsep=space,tableposition=top]{caption}

*   Uncomment the following lines in `preamble.tex` to force a figure to be displayed in a particular location. Use `H` when including graphics. Note `H` instead of `h`.

		\usepackage{float}
		\restylefloat{figure}

*   Bibliography with Author-Year Citation in `preamble.tex`:

        \RequirePackage[round, sort, numbers, authoryear]{natbib}

*   Line spacing for the entire document can be specified in `preamble.tex`. Uncomment the line spacing you prefer. e.g.,
		\onehalfspacing

### Nomenclature definition

* To use nomenclature in your chapters:

        \nomenclature[g-pi]{$\pi$}{ $\simeq 3.14\ldots$}

    The sort keys have prefix. In this case a prefix of `g` is used to denote Greek Symbols, followed by `-pi` or `-sort_key`. Use a `-` to separate sort key from the prefixes. The standard prefixes defined in this class are:

    * `A` or `a`: Roman Symbols

    * `G` or `g`: Greek Symbols

    * `Z` or `z`: Acronyms/Abbreviations

    * `R` or `r`: Superscripts

    * `S` or `s`: Subscripts

    * `X` or `x`: Other Symbols

*   You can change the Title of Nomenclature to Notations or Symbols in the `preamble.tex` using:

        \renewcommand\nomname{Symbols}

 TexStudio's default compile option doesn't include `nomenclature`, to compile your document with the nomenclature, do the following:

		Options >> Configure TexStudio >> Build >> User Commands >> add user command
In `add user command` type `makenomeclature:makenomenclature` on the left pane and `makeindex %.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o %.nls` on the execution side. Now you can run the user defined command `makenomenclature` from `Tools >> User >> makenomenclature`.

Alternatively, you can use the `compile-thesis-windows.bat` file or run `make` on Unix / Linux / MacOS

## To-do Notes

To include custom to-do notes in your pdf document use  `\mynote{Hey! I have a note}` anywhere in your chapters. To activate this feature, you need to uncomment the following lines in `preamble.tex`. To-do notes will be available only in the `draft` or `draftclassic` and not in the final thesis.

	\ifsetDraft
		\usepackage[colorinlistoftodos]{todonotes}
			\newcommand{\mynote}[1]
			{\todo[author=kks32,size=\small,inline,color=green!40]{#1}}
	\else
		\newcommand{\mynote}[1]{}
		\newcommand{\listoftodos}{}
	\fi

## General guidelines
[Why is it important to follow good practices and not get killed by a Velociraptor ;)](http://www.xkcd.com/292/)

*   To restrict the length of the figure caption in List of figures use a \[short-title\] and {longtitle} for the caption or the section:

		`\caption[Caption that you want to appear in TOC]{Actual caption of the figure}`
		`\section[short]{title}`

*   To exclude sections from being numbered and disable it from appearing in the Table of Contents use \section*{Section_Name} or \chapter*{Chapter_Name}

*   To only exclude it from being listed in the Table of Contents encapsulate the section command inside the `\tochide` command. `\tochide{\section{Section_Name}}` the section will not appear in the Table of Contents, but the section will be numbered.

*   When including figures in your tex file, it's a good practice to size your picture depending on the page size, instead of using absolute values. In the following example `0.75\textwidth` refers to picture width being set to 75% of the text width.

        \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{minion}

*   Use a `-` to separate sort key from the prefixes, eg., `g-pi` denotes the Greek symbol `pi`.
